# Contributing to SonarC#

There are many ways you can contribute to the SonarC# project, some very easy and others more involved. We want to be
friendly and welcoming to all potential contributors, so we ask that everyone involved abide by some simple guidelines
outlined in our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Easy Ways to Contribute

One of the easiest ways to contribute is to participate in discussions and discuss issues here on this
[GitHub project](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-dotnet/issues), on
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=sonarqube+c%23) or on our
[Community Forum](https://community.sonarsource.com/).

## General feedback and discussions?

Even if you plan to implement a new rule or fix one by yourself and then submit it back to the community, please start
by creating a new GitHub Issue to get some early feedback on this idea.

## Pull Request (PR)

To submit a contribution, create a pull request for this repository. Please make sure that you follow our
[code style](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-developer-toolset#code-style)

## Custom Rules

If you have an idea for a rule but you are not sure that everyone needs it you can implement a
[custom rule](https://github.com/SonarSource-VisualStudio/sonarqube-roslyn-sdk) available only for you.
